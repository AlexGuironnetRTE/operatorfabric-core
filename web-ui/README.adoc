The adhoc `web-ui` service is now a plain `Nginx` server within a docker container.

The `web-ui` docker is built to contain front files which are overridable for customisation.

For example, override the `favicon` by using the following configuration into the `docker-compose` file :
```
    volumes:
        - "./favicon.ico:/usr/share/nginx/html/favicon.ico"
```

With a favicon named `favicon.ico` is in the same folder of the `docker-compose.yml`.

Use a `Ctrl+F5` to force the `favicon.ico` refresh.

The docker-compose found under config/dev is an example of a such case, where the `favicon.ico` is a gray scale
version of the original one.

This image is part of two `docker-compose` environments. One for deployment which is under
`${OF_HOME}/config/docker` and one for development which is under `${OF_HOME}/config/dev`.

Just in case, and keep it in mind, the `keycloak` docker image has been removed from the `/test-/docker-compose.yml` file.

To remove the orphans images use the following command
```
docker-compose -f ${OF_HOME}/srd/main/docker/test-/docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans
```
