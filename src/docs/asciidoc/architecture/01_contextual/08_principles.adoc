=== Principles

==== Organization principle

===== Leverage some agility during conception and development
Description::
Priority:: Medium
Motivation:: Allow change of priority and adaptation as we must enforce a
symbiotic relationship with other projects which depend on Operator-Fabric.
Implication:: Develop feature during short runs, strong product owning and well
defined use cases
Assurance::
//-

===== Provide continuous quality indicators
Description::
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Being an open source and publically available project,
operator-fabric quality must be advertised to increase other
organizations trust.
Implication:: Introduce continuous integration in the project
including quality analysis tools and quality dashboard. Make produced code
quality a priority for developers to avoid increasing technical debt.
Assurance::
//-

===== Provide continuously updated documentation
Description::
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Operator Fabric’s adoption will partly rely on its accessibility to others
Implication:: Keep both internal and API documentation up to date. Keep up to date public architecture documents
Assurance::
//-

==== Business Principle

===== Allow failure recovery
Description:: Operator Fabric must be suitable for managing critical processes
with high availability. It has to be especially designed to be used in a high
stake environment : life critical processes, high economic value processes and
material. It must avoidloss of data where data is a critical asset.
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Avoid data loss, avoid disrupting operator work.
Implication:: Any developed service or component must ensure that in case of
failure it can be restarted in a state that would avoid disruption of
operators’ tasks. Not all service may be concerned.
Assurance::
//-

===== Allow downgraded mode
Description:: Not all components have the same “life at stake” requirement, if
these components are disrupted we must ensure that components with higher
importance are still available to users and or other services/components.
Solution would depend on the concerned component and may range from producing
default result, used previously cached result, deactivate functionality of
lower importance.
Priority:: Medium
Motivation:: The failure of services or components of less importance must not
disrupt the main process management of the solution functionalities.
Implication:: The implication may be different for different components
Assurance::
//-

===== Relevant process information must be accessible in a holistic view
Description:: The core process functionalities and indicators must be
accessible in a single holistic view. This view must filter information so that
the relevant information on currently running process are presented to the
right audience. Note that the system must still have safeguards to avoid
sensitive information loss.
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Rationalize operator work by providing them relevant information
about their tasks.
Implication::
Assurance::
//-

===== Allow tradability of processes
Description:: Process may be later studied and reviewed. Both the processes
successive states and their associated data must be later accessed.
Priority:: Medium
Motivation:: Allow Post processing verification, allow monitoring
Implication:: Data must be kept for an undefined or defined duration
Assurance::
//-

==== Information Principles

===== Store Data in a readable and accessible way
Description:: It is expected that the business data collected by the
application may be letter consolidated by other services such as data mining
services for instance. To support preliminary study of data during the
conception of relevant data mining algorithm or data science analysis, data
must be easily readable
Priority:: Low (High)
Motivation:: This emanate from a then non proved assumptions which is why the
priority is low but it may have global information architecture influence and
delaying such consideration in the conception and development process may
produce wide later impact. It is thus preferable to take this principle as a
High priority principle.
Implication:: Use a readable format for storage of business related data;
Allow for discovery of business data structure
Assurance::
//-

===== Conforms to user privacy and other local laws
Description:: Ensure that personal information kept in the system conforms to
local laws and organization policy. Personal data is data that can be
used to identify a person.
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Law
Implication::
Assurance::
//-

===== Trace errors
Description:: In a critical system, it is highly important to trace errors.
Special attention must be paid to exchanges with the outside world as well
as configuration grade functionalities which are fed  with out of scope
activities.
Priority:: Medium
Motivation:: Track responsibilities of error for better governance of
solving actions.
Implication:: Document error messages for both system administrators and
monitoring systems
Assurance::
//-

===== Trace communication and exchanges
Description:: for better auditing the activities between components must be
traced. Audit information may be deactivated.
Priority:: Low
Motivation:: Trace activities for debugging and auditing
Implication::
Assurance::
//-

==== Design Decision

===== Use recent tools
Description:: Operator-Fabric being an open source project, its technological
choices must be appealing to other contributor. One way to achieve this is
to adopt recent technologies.
Priority:: Low
Motivation:: Community growth
Implication:: Following recent trends must never contradict other higher
priority principles or constraints.
Assurance::
//-

===== Use standards for communication
Description:: The solution needs to inter connect with other third party
services, these connections must enforce well recognized standards.
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Ease of adoption, robust and well documented solutions
Implication::
Assurance::
//-

===== Use standards for out of scope interactions
Description:: For out of scope interaction we will always prefer well know
standard or protocol over ad-hoc developments
Priority:: High
Motivation::
Implication::
Assurance::
//-

===== Ensure scalability
Description:: As a consequence of the lack of finite target audience, the
solution must be scalable at heart. With this lack of forecast on the target
production environments, the solution must especially be horizontally scalable.
Priority:: High
Motivation:: Uncertainties on target data volume and production infrastructures
Implication::
Assurance::
