=== Risks

==== Absence of finite target audience

Operator-Fabric being a tool for other services and organization, it has no
target audience. It means we cannot completely define the following things :

* number of operators,
* number of third party services,
* target production technical architecture,
* volume of produced data.

Impact::
Not being able to make good architecture choices and not being able to endure
production scale data flows.

Measures::
. Make good architecture choices to allow for both vertical and horizontal
scaling and allow these choices to be precisely tailored to specific parts of
the target solution (for instance we may need to scale operator interactions
with the solution when administering services would not need to scale).
. Analyze the effective performance of the target solution to be able to
advertise its performances and how it could be effectively scaled.
. Isolate components so that eventual down time and lack of performance can be
handled with back pressure management and downgraded mode to avoid complete
failure of system.
. work closely with dependent projects to get relevant information on deployment scaling.
