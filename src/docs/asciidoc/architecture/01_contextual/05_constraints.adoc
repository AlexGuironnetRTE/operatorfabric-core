=== Constraints

==== Use of open source technologies
Priority:: High
Impact::
Make technical choice in a refined set of candidate technologies. Technical
choices will avoid proprietary solutions for software architecture, uncompliant
solutions are acceptable when it comes to specific deployments. When it comes
to friction with external IT solution or deployment solutions, the solution
must enforce widespread standards and protocols.

==== Use of referenced technologies
Priority:: Low
Impact::
Make technical choice in a refined set of candidate technologies. The core team
has its internal set of validated technologies it would allow to run on its
technical infrastructure. This must be regarded as guideline rather then
absolute constraint as it’s meant to also be deployed outside of the core team
infrastructure.
Also note that this rules may be circumvent by the usage of container
technologies to isolate new technologies (virtualization, docker, ...)

==== Open source project
Priority:: High
Impact:: Must comply to the chosen open source license (MPL v2.0), integrated
components must be compatible with the same license. Specifically we also want
to trace restrictive licensed components such as GPL components.

==== Integrate with various existing infrastructure
Priority:: High
Impact:: This is an emanation of the “No finite target audience” risk. We must
define outside components which would cope with Operator-Fabric and enforce
well known and widely adopted standards and protocols. For instance we will
enforce OAuth2 authentication has the authentication mean to integrate with
existing authentication solution or allow bridge implementation between OAuth2
and other standards or specific organization authentication.

==== Available skill pool
Priority:: Medium
Impact:: Technical choices must conform as much as possible to the available
pool of developer which are mainly java developers. Choices may be done outside
this scope but the learning phase must be taken into account.
