=== Business Implementation

This section focuses on some implementation aspects of Business Services and provide some thoughts on the furture
developements of these services


==== Card Publication

Card publication is the central functionality of Operator Fabric. It serves two business purpose:

* Ensure that incoming cards are correctly persisted;
* Ensure that card arrivals are notified to relevant connected users.

In a more technical respect, this service must be scalable to ensure massive volume of cards can be processed.

There are two dimensions to address to scale incoming cards treatment :

* Massive volume of cards;
* Massive simultaneous connection by Thirds;

To modulate card input capacity, we have two levers:

* Optimize card treatment at service level
* Run multiple instances of service

===== Service level optimization

In addition to some business specific manipulation and validation of data, the input life cycle of card is as follow

. Multiple http publishes cards (In Java servlet there should be one thread per request)
. Cards are aggregated in a single stream data
. Batches of cards are then build and treated by different threads as seen fit (i.e. one batch is created every X cards
or every Y milliseconds)
. Each batch of cards is persisted and notified to users

===== Multiple service instances (thoughts on future needs)

Running multiple service instances. In a multiple service environment problems should arise when multiple cards for
same process are submited. This may impact both persistence and notification.

====== Persistence

The risk is for added card to the card collection to be added in a wrong order, there is no risk for the archived card
collection. One way to solve this is to enrich the upsert query (CardWriteService#addBulkCard) with additional
criterias (based on the publish date or on an added ordinal managed by 3rd party service).

====== Notification

Impacts on card notification adds no additional risk to data integrity itself but as incorrect notification of cards
to user may arise, it may lead for users to make poor or eroneous business decisions.

There currently two means forseen to ensure correct notification

*Invalidate data in client side*

A card would have some expiration time, when exceeded the client ask to revalidate the card if it is still valid a new
validity is set otherwise the card is removed from client.

*Centralize and order notification*

The notification process may be delegated to some specific services pool using an in memory high performance cache to
store cards to be notified as a queue
