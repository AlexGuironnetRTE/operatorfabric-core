=== Micro-Service Architecture Principles

NB: Blue colored component should be naturally redundable in a micro service architecture other components redeundancy
may be subject to implementation choices.

==== Registry

Is the central component where all services are registred. It serves as a reference point for the gateway and other
services to find information about the running services instance and allow for local load balancing of accesses.

==== Gateway

Provides a filtered view of the APIS and static served pages for external access through browsers or other http
complient accesses (e.g. REST, SOAP).

==== Configuration

A configuration service is not mandatory in a microservice but may allows for better sharing of common configuration and
to dispatch global configuration changes to all services.

==== Business Services & Web UI (Micro Services)

Are both business services registred within the microservice registry. We distinguish both only to separate business
operation from static content serving

==== Asynchronous messaging

Use to share information asynchronously across the whole services
