=== Business Target Architecture

Our Front-end application is an Angular 7 SPA (Single Page Application/

Aside from modularization consideration, the application architecture is described by the following diagram.

image::image::03_03_web_ui_implementation/WebUI Architecture.png[Angular With Redux Architecture]

The Web UI architecture is a combination of the standard Angular Architecture and NGRX framework structure,
a simplified implementation of the Redux pattern. On the above diagram green components are provide by Angular and NGRX
frameworks, yellow components are implemented as needed following the rules of these frameworks.

==== Angular Architecture Components

===== Components

Components are angular basic unit of UX representation, they allow interaction with Angular Services through calls and
NGRX State through action dispatch (state mutation) and selector observables (state consultation/state change
notification)

===== Views

Views are Components themselves, they agregate components are target  of Routes (Router)

===== Router

The Angular Router allows to configure Navigation through router modules (modules that declare routes and allow for
lazy loading). Routes msut be kept resource compatible as needed. The Angular Router is coupled with NGRX State so that
route change dispatch actions that can be captured by NGRX Effects and special routing actions can be dispatched to
trigger Angular Router.

==== Service

Business or Technical services for UX these are singletons injected into Components, Effects and other Services

==== NGRX Architecture Components

Aside from provided NGRX components, one NGRX component is implemented for each relevant business domain. For instance
considering Feed, ther is one feed State, one Feed Reducer, one Feed Action enumeration, a collection of Feed Selectors
and a collection of Feed Effects.

===== Store

The Store is the global entry to manipulate NGRX components.

===== State

The State aggregates the data manipulated by the application.

===== Dispatcher

Accessed thought Store this NGRX provided component controls the State mutations. It allows to emit Actions

===== Reducer

Controls how to update the application State for corresponding Actions

===== Selector

Extract slice of data from State. Combined with Store methods, allows to generate Observable for constant notification
of State updates.

===== Effects

Effects are combination of Action detection, decisions regarding input Action, calls to Services, decision regarding
Services call results and new Action emission as result of the effect. They allow to chain actions between them with
more or less complex decision and operation in between.

===== Remote APIs

These are our backend REST Apis
