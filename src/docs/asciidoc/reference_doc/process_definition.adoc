= Declaring a Process and its configuration

The business configuration for processes is declared in the form of a bundle, as described below.
Once this bundle fully created, it must be uploaded to the server through the Businessconfig service.

The way configuration is done is explained with examples before a more technical review of the configuration details.
The following instructions describe tests to perform on OperatorFabric to understand how customization is working in it.
The card data used here are sent automatically using a script as described
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<card_sending_script, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#card_sending_script, here>>]
.

== Requirements

Those examples are played in an environment where an OperatorFabric instance (all micro-services) is running along
a MongoDB Database and a RabbitMQ instance.

== Bundle

A bundle contains all the configuration regarding a given business process, describing for example the various steps
of the process but also how the associated cards and card details should be displayed.
Those `tar.gz` archives contain a descriptor file
named `config.json`, eventually some `css files`, `i18n files` and `handlebars templates` to do so.

For didactic purposes, in this section, the businessconfig name is `BUNDLE_TEST` (to match the parameters used by the script).
This bundle is localized for `en` and `fr`.

As detailed in the `Businessconfig core service README` the bundle contains at least a metadata file called `config.json`,
a `css` folder, an `i18n` folder and a `template` folder.
All elements except the `config.json file` are optional.

The files of this example are organized as below:

....
bundle
├── config.json
├── css
│   └── bundleTest.css
├── i18n
│   ├── en.json
│   └── fr.json
└── template
    ├── en
    │   ├── template1.handlebars
    │   └── template2.handlebars
    └── fr
        ├── template1.handlebars
        └── template2.handlebars
....

=== The config.json file

It's a description file in `json` format. It lists the content of the bundle.

*example*

[source,JSON]
----
include::../../../../services/core/businessconfig/src/main/docker/volume/businessconfig-storage/TEST/config.json[]
----

- id: id of the process
- name: process name (i18n key);
- version: enable the correct display, even the old ones as all versions are stored by the server. Your *card* has a version
field that will be matched to businessconfig configuration for correct rendering ;
- states  : list the available  states; actions and templates are associated to states, in the same way is the possibility of making the cards enabled for being acknowledged by user;
- css file template list as `csses`;
- menuLabel in the main bar menu as `i18nLabelKey`: optional, used if the businessconfig service add one or several entry in
the OperatorFabric main menu bar, see the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<menu_entries, menu entries>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#menu_entries, menu entries>>]
section for details;
- extra menu entries as `menuEntries`: optional, see below for the declaration format of objects of this array, see the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<menu_entries, menu entries>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#menu_entries, menu entries>>]
section for details;

The mandatory declarations are `id`,'name' and `version` attributes.

See the
ifdef::single-page-doc[link:../api/businessconfig/index.html[Businessconfig API documentation]]
ifndef::single-page-doc[link:{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/index.html[Businessconfig API documentation]]
for details.

=== i18n

There are two ways of i18n for businessconfig service. The first one is done using l10n files which are located in the `i18n`
folder, the second one throughout l10n name folder nested in the `template` folder.

The `i18n` folder contains one json file per l10n.

These localisation is used for integration of the businessconfig service into OperatorFabric, i.e. the label displayed for the
process , the state , the label displayed for each tab of the details of the card, the label of the actions...

====  Template folder

The `template` folder must contain localized folder for the i18n of the card details. This is why in our example, as the bundle is localized for `en` and `fr` language, the `template` folder contains a `en` and a `fr` folder.

===== i18n file

If there is no i18n file or key is missing, the i18n key is displayed in OperatorFabric.

The choice of i18n keys is left to the Businessconfig service maintainer. The keys are referenced in the following places:

* `config.json` file:
	** `i18nLabelKey`: key used for the label for the businessconfig service displayed in the main menu bar of OperatorFabric;
	** `label` of `menu entry declaration`: key used to l10n the `menu entries` declared by the Businessconfig party in the bundle;
* `card data`: values of `card title` and `card summary` refer to `i18n keys` as well as `key attribute` in the
`card detail` section of the card data.

*example*

So in this example the process is named `Bundle Test` with `BUNDLE_TEST` technical name. The bundle provide an
english and a french l10n.

The example bundle defined an new menu entry given access to 3 entries. The title and the summary have to be l10n,
so needs to be the 2 tabs titles.

The name of the process as displayed in the main menu bar of OperatorFabric. It will have the key
`"businessconfig-name-in-menu-bar"`. The english l10n will be `Bundle Test` and the french one will be `Bundle de test`.

A name for the three entries in the process entry menu. Their keys will be in order `"first-menu-entry"`, `"b-menu-entry"` and `"the-other-menu-entry"` for an english l10n as `Entry One`, `Entry Two` and `Entry Three` and in french as `Entrée une`, `Entrée deux` and `Entrée trois`.

The title for the card and its summary. As the card used here are generated by the script of the `cards-publication` project we have to used the key declared there. So they are respectively `process.title` and `process.summary` with the following l10ns for english: `Card Title` and `Card short description`, and for french l10ns: `Titre de la carte` and `Courte description de la carte`.

A title for each (two of them) tab of the detail cards. As for card title and card summary, those keys are already defined by the test script. There are `"process.detail.tab.first"` and `"process.detail.tab.second"`. For english l10n, the values are `First Detail List` and `Second Detail List` and for the french l10n, the values are `Première liste de détails` and `Seconde liste de détails`.

Here is the content of `en.json`
....
{
	"businessconfig-name-in-menu-bar":"Bundle Test",
		"first-menu-entry":"Entry One",
		"b-menu-entry":"Entry Two",
		"the-other-menu-entry":"Entry Three",
		"process":{
			"title":"Card Title",
			"summary":"Card short description",
			"detail":{
				"tab":{
					"first":"First Detail List",
					"second":"Second Detail List"
				}
			}
		}
}
....
Here the content of `fr.json`
....
{
	"businessconfig-name-in-menu-bar":"Bundle de test",
		"first-menu-entry":"Entrée une",
		"b-menu-entry":"Entrée deux",
		"the-other-menu-entry":"Entrée trois",
		"process":{
			"title":"Titre de la carte",
			"summary":"Courte description de la carte",
			"detail":{
				"tab":{
					"first":"Première liste de détails",
					"second":"Deuxième liste de détails"
				}
			}
		}
}
....

Once the bundle is correctly uploaded, the way to verify if the i18n have been correctly uploaded is to use the GET 
method of businessconfig api for i18n file.

The endpoint is described
ifdef::single-page-doc[link:../api/businessconfig/index.html#/businessconfig/getI18n[here]]
ifndef::single-page-doc[link:{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/index.html#/businessconfig/getI18n[here]]
.

The `locale` language, the `version` of the bundle and the `technical name` of the businessconfig party are needed to get
json in the response.

To verify if the french l10n data of the version 1 of the BUNDLE_TEST businessconfig party we could use the following
command line

`curl -X GET "http://localhost:2100/businessconfig/BUNDLE_TEST/i18n?locale=fr&version=1" -H  "accept: application/json"`

The service response with a 200 status and with the json corresponding to the defined fr.json file show below.

....
{
"businessconfig-name-in-menu-bar":"Bundle de test",
"first-menu-entry":"Entrée une",
"b-menu-entry":"Entrée deux",
"the-other-menu-entry":"Entrée trois",
"tests":{
	"title":"Titre de la carte",
	"summary":"Courte description de la carte",
	"detail":{
		"tab":{
			"first":"Première liste de détails",
			"second":"Deuxième liste de détails"
			}
		}
}
}
....

[[menu_entries]]
==== Menu Entries

Those elements are declared  in the `config.json` file of the bundle. 

If there are several items to declare for a businessconfig service, a title for the businessconfig menu section need to be declared
within the `i18nLabelKey` attribute, otherwise the first and only `menu entry` item is used to create an entry in the
menu nav bar of OperatorFabric.

===== config.json declaration

This kind of objects contains the following attributes :

- `id`: identifier of the entry menu in the UI;
- `url`: url opening a new page in a tab in the browser;
- `label`: it's an i18n key used to l10n the entry in the UI.
- `linkType`: Defines how business menu links are displayed in the navigation bar and how
they open. Possible values:
** TAB: Only a text link is displayed, and clicking it opens the link in a new tab.
** IFRAME: Only a text link is displayed, and clicking it opens the link in an iframe in the main content zone below
the navigation bar.
** BOTH: Both a text link and a little arrow icon are displayed. Clicking the text link opens the link in an iframe
while clicking the icon opens in a new tab. This is also the default value.


====== Examples

In the following examples, only the part relative to menu entries in the `config.json` file is detailed, the other parts are omitted and represented with a '…'.

*Single menu entry*

....
{
	…
	"menuEntries":[{
			"id": "identifer-single-menu-entry",
			"url": "https://opfab.github.io",
			"label": "single-menu-entry-i18n-key",
			"linkType": "BOTH"	
		}],
}
....

*Several menu entries*

Here a sample with 3 menu entries.

....
{
	…
	"i18nLabelKey":"businessconfig-name-in-menu-navbar",
	"menuEntries": [{
			"id": "firstEntryIdentifier",
			"url": "https://opfab.github.io/whatisopfab/",
			"label": "first-menu-entry",
			"linkType": "BOTH"
		},
		{
			"id": "secondEntryIdentifier",
			"url": "https://www.lfenergy.org/",
			"label": "second-menu-entry"
		} ,
		{
			"id": "businessconfigEntryIdentifier",
			"url": "https://opfab.github.io",
			"label": "businessconfig-menu-entry"
		}]
}
....

==== Processes and States
//==== Card details

Processes and their states allows to match a Businessconfig Party service process specific state to a list of templates for card details and
actions allowing specific card rendering for each state of the business process.

The purpose of this section is to display elements of businessconfig card data in a custom format.

Regarding the card detail customization, all the examples in this section will be based on the cards generated by the script existing in the `Cards-Publication` project. For the examples given here, this script is run with arguments detailed in the following command line:

[[card_sending_script]]
....
$OPERATOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_card_loop.sh
....

where:

- `$OPERATOR_FABRIC_HOME` is the root folder of OperatorFabric where tests are performed;
- `BUNDLE_TEST` is the name of the Businessconfig party;
- `tests` is the name of the process referred by published cards.

===== configuration

The process entry in the configuration file is a dictionary of processes, each key maps to a process definition.
A process definition is itself a dictionary of states, each key maps to a state definition. A state is defined by:

* a list of details: details are a combination of an internationalized title (title), css class styling element
(titleStyle) and a template reference
* a dictionary of actions: actions are described below

===== Templates

For demonstration purposes, there will be two simple templates. For more advance feature go to the section detailing the handlebars templates in general and helpers available in OperatorFabric.
As the card used in this example are created
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<card_sending_script, above>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#card_sending_script, above>>]
, the bundle template folder needs to contain 2 templates: `template1.handlebars` and `template2.handlebars`.

examples of template (i18n versions)

`/template/en/template1.handlers`
....

<h2>Template Number One</h2>
<div class="bundle-test">'{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}'</div>
....

`/template/fr/template1.handlers`
....
<h2>Patron numéro Un</h2>
<div class="bundle-test">'{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}'</div>
....
Those templates display a l10n title and an line containing the value of the scope property `card.level1.level1Prop` which is `This is a root property`.

`/template/en/template2.handelbars`
....
<h2>Second Template</h2>
<ul class="bundle-test-list">
	{{#each card.data.level1.level1Array}}
		<li class="bunle-test-list-item">{{this.level1ArrayProp}}</li>
	{{/each}}
</ul>
....
`/template/fr/template2.handelbars`
....
<h2>Second patron</h2>
<ul class="bundle-test-list">
	{{#each card.data.level1.level1Array}}
		<li class="bunle-test-list-item">{{this.level1ArrayProp}}</li>
	{{/each}}
</ul>
....

Those templates display also a l10n title and a list of numeric values from 1 to 3.

===== CSS

This folder contains regular css files.
The file name must be declared in the `config.json` file in order to be used in the templates and applied to them.

====== Examples

As above, all parts of files irrelevant for our example are symbolised by a `…` character.

*Declaration of css files in `config.json` file*

....
{
	…
	"csses":["bundleTest"]
	…
}
....

*CSS Class used in `./template/en/template1.handlebars`*

....
	…
	<div class="bundle-test">'{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}'</div>
	…
....
As seen above, the value of `{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}` of a test card is `This is a level1 property`

*Style declaration in `./css/bundleTest.css`*

....
.h2{
	color:#fd9312;
	font-weight: bold;
}
....

*Expected result*

image::expected-result.png[Formatted root property]

==== Upload

For this, the bundle is submitted to the OperatorFabric server using a POST http method as described in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<../api/businessconfig/#/businessconfig/uploadBundle, Businessconfig Service API documentation>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/#/businessconfig/uploadBundle, Businessconfig Service API documentation>>]
.

Example :
....
cd $BUNDLE_FOLDER
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2100/businessconfig" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@bundle-test.tar.gz;type=application/gzip"
....

Where:

- `$BUNDLE_FOLDER` is the folder containing the bundle archive to be uploaded.
- `bundle-test.tar.gz` is the name of the uploaded bundle.

These command line should return a `200 http status` response with the details of the content of the bundle in the response body such as :
....
