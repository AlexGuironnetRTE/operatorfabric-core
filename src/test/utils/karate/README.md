# operatorfabric-api-testing
Api testing with Karate DSL 

To use it download the last karate.jar from github : https://github.com/intuit/karate/releases/

Put it in the karate directory , rename it to karate.jar for easier use

If your operator fabric instance is not running on localhost , you need to replace localhost with the adress of your running instance in the karate-config.js file. 

To test a feature : java -jar karate.jar myfeature.feature

The result will be available on the target repository.
