== Demonstration

This section demonstrates how to interact with the Time service through its API 
by following a few simple scenarios.

=== Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: For these examples to work, you need to have a running Time service.
The requests below assume that the Time service is running on localhost on port 
2101 (see 
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/blob/master/README.md[demo 
setup]).

You can choose from several ways to send requests to the API, among which:

* Using curl (command line)
* Using API development tools such as link:https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman]

We will use curl for our examples.

IMPORTANT: In the following commands the `$token` is a valid authentication 
token from the `OAuth2` server used by the current `OperatorFabric` instance.

//TODO Add detail or link explaining how to get token

NOTE: Another option would be to use the Swagger UI. Provided that you have the 
Time service running on localhost on port 2101,
the Swagger UI for the Time API is available at http://localhost:2101/ . It 
also displays documentation and examples next to each request.
However, requests requiring authentication won't work as it isn't set up yet.

=== Scenario 1: Getting the current virtual time

Let's say we want to get the current virtual time, which we expect to be equal
to real server time so far.

NOTE: No authentication is required for this request.

.Curl command
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2101/time" \
    -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
----

.Response code
----
200 OK
----

.Response body
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "referenceTime": null, // <1>
    "virtualTime": null, // <1>
    "computedNow": 1553617695195, // <2>
    "speed": "X1" // <3>
}
----
<1> Since the time hasn't been changed yet, referenceTime and virtualTime 
haven't been set.
<2> The current virtual time (number of milliseconds since Epoch), for example 
this value converts to _March 26, 2019 4:28:15.195 PM GMT_
<3> Speed of the virtual time flow relatively to real time flow. X1 means 
they're the same.

TIP: You can use an link:https://www.epochconverter.com/[online converter] to 
switch between epochDate and human readable date.

=== Scenario 2: Setting virtual time to be 10 minutes ahead of real time

To set virtual time to be 10 minutes ahead of time, we use the POST request and 
set the intended virtual time start (10 minutes from now) in the body:

.Example body
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "referenceTime": null, // <1>
    "virtualTime": 1554111652000, // <2>
    "computedNow": null, // <1>
    "speed": null // <1>
}
----
<1> These can be left blank as they won't be used
<2> This should be the intended start of virtual time, about 10 minutes ahead 
from now

.Curl command
----
curl -X POST \
    http://localhost:2101/time \
    -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
    -d '{
        "referenceTime": null,
        "virtualTime": 1554111652000,
        "computedNow": null,
        "speed": null
}'
----

The response contains the current virtual time (computedNow) as well as the 
references used for the computation.

.Response code
----
200 OK
----

.Response body
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "referenceTime": 1554111014449, // <1>
    "virtualTime": 1554111652000, // <2>
    "computedNow": 1554111652009, // <3>
    "speed": "X1" // <4>
}
----
<1> Real time at the time of the time change = _April 1, 2019 9:30:14.449 AM 
GMT_
<2> Chosen start of virtual time = _April 1, 2019 9:40:52 AM GMT_
<3> Current virtual time = _April 1, 2019 9:40:52.009 AM_ -> 9 milliseconds 
have elapsed since server time change
<4> Speed hasn't been changed.

TIP: PUT /time does the exact same thing as POST /time as there was no need for 
a different behaviour.

Let's ask for the current time again (using the GET request) a little while 
later (real time is _April 1, 2019 11:37:43 AM GMT_)

.curl command
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2101/time" \
    -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
----

.Response code
----
200 OK
----

.Response body
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "referenceTime": 1554111014449, <1>
    "virtualTime": 1554111652000, <2>
    "computedNow": 1554119300367, <3>
    "speed": "X1" <4>
}
----
<1> Real time at the time of the time change = _April 1, 2019 9:30:14.449 AM 
GMT_
<2> Chosen start of virtual time = _April 1, 2019 9:40:52 AM GMT_
<3> Current virtual time = _April 1, 2019 11:48:20.367_ -> virtual time is 
about 10 minutes ahead from real time as expected
<4> Speed hasn't been changed.

IMPORTANT: Notice how referenceTime, virtualTime and speed haven't changed from 
the response to the POST request to set the virtual time. They will only change 
the next time is set or reset.


//TODO Finish API call examples: change speed, reset
//TODO Sort out authentication through Swagger UI or adapt instructions to use 
Postman to get token
