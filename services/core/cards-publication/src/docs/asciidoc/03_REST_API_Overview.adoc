== Publication REST API Overview.

=== Publish Cards

As <<_publish_card, seen here>> the main publication method is to post Card using an http `POST` method to the endpoint `/cards` with a card as `json` object in the body of the request.

There is an asynchrone metho available whom end-point is `/async/cards`. The response for this method is always a `201` status, no matter what the card is accepted or not.

=== Delete Cards

For a given `process id` it's possible to delete the current card (not the archived ones), using the `DELETE` http method with the following end-point `/cards/{processId}` where `processId` is the id of the choosen process. In `OperatorFabric` calling this method will trigger a `DELETE CardOperation` with the `id` of the current card linked to the request process.

=== Other methods 

The other methods declared in the link:../api/[Card Management] are used by the GUI and are parts of the `Card Consultation API`.
